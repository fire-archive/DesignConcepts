== Level 0: What Is Game Design Concepts? [[level-0]]

_Originally posted March 31, 2009 and April 21, 2009_

My name is Ian Schreiber. I've been working in the video game industry since the turn of the millennium, first as a programmer and then as a game designer. I've taught college classes in game design since Fall 2006. For any other information, you can Google me.

=== What is this book?

This book is an experiment in game design and pedagogy. During Summer 2009, a series of lectures, course notes, readings, and challenges were posted to this blog on the subject of game design.

This book is a course in game design (specifically, non-digital systems design).

* Tuition: *none*. This class is open to all.

* Prerequisites: *none*. It is my intention to make this course accessible to all levels of experience, while providing useful additional resources for those who are advanced.

* Schedule: Take it at your own pace; when originally posted, there were two articles a week posted over the course of 9 weeks.

* Audience: anyone with an interest in game design. This includes students who are interested in game design; faculty who teach courses in game design and would like to compare course material; game developers with an interest in design or a desire to see an example of what students are being taught these days; or relatives of game designers who are curious about what these people do all day.

=== Course Description

This course provides students with a theoretical and conceptual understanding of the field of game design, along with practical exposure to the process of creating a game. Topics covered include iteration, rapid prototyping, mechanics, dynamics, flow theory, the nature of fun, game balance, and user interface design. Primary focus is on non-digital games.

=== Course Objectives

In this class, we will discuss games and game design. We will discover what the components of games are, and what parts of games are influenced by their design. We will learn several ways to approach the design of a game, and processes and best practices for prototyping, playtesting and balancing a game after it has been designed.

=== Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be familiar with the (relatively small) body of work that is accepted in the game industry as the theoretical foundation of game design. You will also be comfortable enough in processes to start designing your own games, as well as critically analyzing other people's games.

=== Why are you doing this?

I have many motivations for starting this project, some selfish and some altrusitic. Best to be up front about it:

* Game design is my passion, and I love to share it with anyone and everyone.

* I have taught some classes in a traditional classroom and others online, and I want to experiment with alternate methods of teaching. By exposing my course content and viewing the comments and discussions, I can improve the course when I teach it for money. It is a career move. If this course is successful, it gives me greater exposure in my field and promotes my name as a brand.

=== Is this really, totally, 100% free?

The book is free. There are some minor costs:

* There is a required textbook. It retails for under $25 US.

* Part of the course will involve the creation of a fully realized non-digital project, so you may need to purchase materials. These usually range from $25 to $50, depending on the game.It's still cheaper than college tuition.

=== Textbooks

This course has one required text, and two recommended texts that will be referenced in several places and provide good "next steps" after the summer course ends.

==== Required Text

_Challenges for Game Designers_ by Brathwaite & Schreiber. This book covers a lot of basic information on both practical and theoretical game design, and we will be using it heavily, supplemented with some readings from other online sources. Yes, I am one of the authors. The reason Brenda and I wrote this book was because we wanted a text to use in our classes, and nothing like it existed at the time... so we made our own.

==== Recommended Texts

_Understanding Comcs: The Invisible Art_ by McCloud. While this book claims to be about comics, many of the lessons within can be applied to game design and other forms of art. It also happens to be a comic book itself, and fun to read.

_A Theory of Fun for Game Design_ by Koster. This book shows the similarities between game design and education, with a good discussion of the concept of Flow. Half text and half cartoons, this short book flows nicely and can be read in an afternoon or two.

=== Syllabus

The following syllabus is a reprinting of the syllabus as it appeared on the original site during the course. It is reprinted here to give you an idea of the pacing of the original course, in addition to acting as a summary of the upcoming course.

=== Schedule:

This class runs from *Monday, June 29* through *Sunday, September 6*. Posts appear on the blog Mondays and Thursdays each week at *noon GMT*. Discussions and sharing of ideas happen on a continual basis.

=== Textbooks:

This course has one required text, and two recommended texts that will be referenced in several places and provide good “next steps” after the summer course ends.

=== A Note About Change:

As this entire course is an experiment, the schedule in this syllabus is subject to change based on the needs of the students and the overall pace of the course.
